# ISRO Links Scraper

This Python script scrapes the ISRO website (https://www.isro.gov.in) and extracts links inside div elements with the class 'accordion-body'. The extracted data is saved in a CSV file with a unique filename, including the current date and time.

This is done out of love for the rich content that is uploaded on the site of ISRO.
Made with 💝💖 & admiration of ISRO and the work they do. 
## Requirements

- Python 3.x

...
```

The filename will have the format `isro_links_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`, where `YYYYMMDD` is the current date and `HHMMSS` is the current time.
